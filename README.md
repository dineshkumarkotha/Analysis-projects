**Analysis of Inflation Rates and Exchange Rates: India and USA
**
Introduction

This report analyzes the relationship between inflation rates and exchange rates between India and the United States. Using data visualized in Power BI and documented insights, we aim to understand the trends, deviations, and their implications over several decades.

Data Overview

Data Sources:

Inflation Rates: Yearly inflation data for both India and the USA.

Exchange Rates: Average exchange rates (INR/USD) and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).

Deviation Metrics: Difference between actual exchange rates and theoretical PPP values.

Key Timeframes:

Historical data spans from 1980 to 2024.

Detailed observations highlight major economic events and trends.

Visualization Insights

1. Inflation Trends (India vs USA)

Observation: The inflation rate in India is generally higher than in the USA, reflecting differing economic structures and monetary policies.

Implication: A higher inflation rate in India contributes to a weaker INR against USD over time.

2. Exchange Rate Trends (INR/USD)

Observation: The average exchange rate (INR/USD) has increased steadily, with the INR depreciating from approximately 53.40 INR/USD in 2012 to 83.31 INR/USD in 2024.

PPP Analysis: A gap exists between the exchange rate and PPP, indicating deviations caused by inflation differentials and external economic factors.

3. Deviation Metrics

Observation: Deviation between exchange rates and PPP highlights market inefficiencies and speculative factors.

Trend: Deviations are more pronounced during global financial crises and economic reforms.

Findings

Impact of Inflation on Exchange Rates:

Inflation in India directly correlates with the steady depreciation of the INR.

The USA's stable inflation rate contributes to the relative strength of the USD.

Economic Events:

Major deviations align with events such as the 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and global inflationary pressures.

Exchange Rate Behavior:

Exchange rates are influenced not only by inflation but also by foreign investments, monetary policies, and global market trends.

Conclusions

Inflation rate differences between India and the USA significantly impact the INR/USD exchange rate.

Exchange rate deviations from PPP provide insights into market dynamics beyond inflation.

Policymakers should address inflationary pressures to stabilize currency values and improve economic resilience.

Future Recommendations

For Analysts: Incorporate additional factors such as trade balances, interest rates, and GDP growth for a holistic view.

For Policymakers: Focus on measures to control inflation and attract foreign investment to stabilize the INR.
